A responsive theme for [Nginx Fancyindex module](https://github.com/aperezdc/ngx-fancyindex). Minimal, modern and simple theme for your **nginx** directory listing with same appearance of Apaxy for apache.
Here is a demo of what the result looks like: [lfsystems DEMO](https://www.lfsystems.com.co/fileserver/).

# Usage
- Make sure you have the [Fancyindex module](https://github.com/aperezdc/ngx-fancyindex) compiled with nginx, either by compiling it yourself or installing nginx via the full distribution (paquet nginx-extras).

- Include the content of **nginxy.conf** in your location directive (location / {.....}) in your nginx config (usually nginx.conf).

- Move the *Nginxy-Theme/* folder a directory before the folder that will serve the files and rename it to **.nginxy/** As shown in the following screenshot:

- Restart/reload nginx.

- Check that it's working, and enjoy!
